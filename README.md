# Recipe Finder App

# About

Welcome to our group's recipe finder app. The purpose of this app is to easily find high quality recipes based on the ingredients you have in stock.

The app is built using ReactJs, NodeJs, CSS

Utilizes CRUD methodology and RESTful APIs to build a recipe finder web application that provides users access to 1000+ recipes and narrows down options based on their ingredient search.

Allows users to view key information for each recipe, save their favorite recipes which they can later access from the “Favorites’ tab, and add ingredients to a shopping list.
